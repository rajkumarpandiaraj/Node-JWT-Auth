                        10.JWT Theory

1.user login through the browser with email and password and sent it to the server.
2.In server, that crenditals is check with db, if that is exis,server creates a cookies and sent it to the browser.
3.Cookies sent with req to th browser, based on that server the page.


JSON Web Token
1.JWT is a encoded long string with three parts, 1.red, 2.Purple and 3.Blue.

1.Red(Header)
    --> Tells the server what type of signatire is being used[meta data]

2.Purple(Payoad)
    --> Used to identify the user[eg: contains user id]

3.Blue(Signature)
    --> Makes the token secure(like a stamp of authenticity)


after user login, servercreates jwt by

    by hasing the header and payload together and creates the secret string
    And adds the signature with the secret string.

After creating the jwt, it sent to the browser as cookie

while receiving the req, server checks the jwt cookie and show/hide the page based on that.
