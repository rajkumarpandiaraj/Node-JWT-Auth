                                        16.Logging User out


To logout user we have to delete the jwt cookie
To do That  
    --> create a logout button 
    --> make a post request to the backend
    --> we can't delete the cook manually so we change the jwt cookie value to ''[empty string] with small expiry value

    In controller/authController/js
        module.exports.logout_get = (req, res) => {
        res.cookie('jwt', '', { maxAge: 1 });
        res.redirect('/');
    }
